A long time ago, I messed up my music library and ever since its been all messy, this script fixes that.

To use just run cleanitup.pl it will prompt you for an input and output directory.
Please be sure to have different input and output directories for safety.

outputs in format:
Output Directory/Artist/Album/[Track]Name
